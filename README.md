# Kita Kita: Obstacle Detection for Safer Mobility
This is a project for our Computer Vision Class. We made use of object detection for obstacle detection in streets for safer mobility especially for people who are visually impaired. Our team made use of YOLOv11 for object detection model and Roboflow datasets for the datasets to train the model. For the web app, we made use of OpenCV and Streamlit to incorporate camera and video input and output.
